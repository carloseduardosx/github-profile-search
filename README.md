> **Tips**

You can see your changes by running the script:
```shellscript
yarn start
```

If you want to make a deploy of your changes, you can run the following command:
```shellscript
yarn run deploy
```

Try run the tests to check if you changes are working properly:
```shellscript
yarn test
```

If you're creating tests, you can run the `test:watch` script to avoid waste time by running the `test` script multiple times:
```shellscript
yarn run test:watch
```

> **OBS: Only contributors can deploy changes, so don't waste your time deploying if you aren't one.**
